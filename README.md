# Horses of Lake Valley

## Description

This project is a game about horses, with main focus on breeding according to how real life horse genetics work. Games that by definition should include genetics and actually put some thought into the genetics system are my passion. I used a few sources in my research into the horse genetics, but the main one was https://www.etalondx.com/horse-color-simulator. This simulator was presented in an easily understandable form and showed enough coat variations, so I decided to build my project around the system similar to this one.

Originally I planned to focus just on the breeding, training and competing mechanics, but later I felt the game was too lacking, so I decided to implement at least one mini-game which was connected to a quest. The prize for completing the quest is getting a supernatural horse - kelpie, instead of originally planned unicorn, because the quest was tied to the lake mini-game and this made more sense. These supernatural horses also introduce a smaller addition to how genetics work - it is possible to breed new kelpies and hybrids that look somewhat like both of these life states.

Some of the things I have planned to implement but in the end didn't are: a tutorial for new players, being able to choose the starting horses (which is not impossible but is tricky as the genes define the horse's appearance, not vice versa), and player achievements (like the coat colors the player was able to breed or obtain in any other way).

All visuals were drawn by me with the exception of the shop lady who was drawn by my friend. Music and sounds are credited in-game.
